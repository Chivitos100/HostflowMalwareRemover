# HostflowMalwareRemover
A command line tool to detect &amp; remove "hostflow" malware from infected plugins.

## Installation
Download it and drop it on your server root folder (where files like bukkit.yml etc are located)

## Usage

#### Detection mode:
```
Start your server with HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

- java -jar HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

If you use some panel you will have to select custom server version and then select this jar.
```

If it says it found malware then you will have to do the next step.

#### Remover mode:

```
Start your server with HostflowMalwareRemover.jar and add -D"remover=true"

- java -jar HostflowMalwareRemover.jar -D"remover=true"

If you use some panel you will have to select custom server version and then select this jar,
now in your panel in parameters add at start -D"remover=true"
(if you cant do that you will have to contact your host provider and ask them to add that or run the tool for you)
```

When it is done all the clean plugins will be in "plugins-clean" folder,
then rename "plugins" folder to "plugins1" or something (for backup purposes incase it doesnt remove the malware properly)
and now you can rename "plugins-clean" to "plugins"
